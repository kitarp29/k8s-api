##  <u>**Introduction**</u> üëãüèª

It is built on **Golang** and utilizes the **client-go** library to interact with Kubernetes Cluster.
It is a plug-and-play solution and can be used to create a kube-ez server. In three easy steps, you will have a simple API to interact with your cluster.
The aim is to build a simple API server that can be used to interact with any Kubernetes cluster.

 In my industrial experience, I have realized that **Kubernetes** is a very powerful tool but, only used by a handful of developers in the organization. The problem is not grasping the concept of the cluster. My last Product Manager was much more versed in AWS than I am. 
I feel the reason is that there is no easier way to interact with it.
This project will provide a bunch of API endpoints to perform various functions on the cluster. For now, I will have the Postman collections and API docs to achieve it, plan is to build a Dashboard on the API later.

**Docker Image: [kitarp29/k8s-api](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kitarp29/k8s-api)**
> Use the Docker image with tag 2.0 or above to run the kube-ez server.

## <u>**Getting started**</u> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To start using the project you need a Kubernetes Cluster and should have the right access to apply changes to the cluster.
The project can be run *inside* the cluster and from *outside* the cluster. We will first discuss how to run the project from *inside* the cluster.
## **Steps to follow** ü™ú
- ## **Service Account**:

  We need to make a custom service account to be able to interact with the cluster. We will use this service account in our pod on which we will run the API.</br>
 Command to make a service account: </br>
    ```
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: <Your-Custom-Name>
    EOF
    ```
  Or you can apply the [YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/main/yamls/sa.yaml) using:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/main/yamls/sa.yaml
  ```
   > We can also use the *default* service account. But it is not recommended.
  
  > Verify the service account by running the following command: kubectl get serviceaccounts/Your-Custom-Name -o yaml
- ## **Cluster Role**:
  
  We need to make a custom cluster role to be able to interact with the cluster. We will use this cluster role to bind to our **Service Account**. The role should have permission to all the resources in order for the project to run smoothly.
  I would advise you not to make any role and use the *cluster-admin* role directly. Still, if you want to create a custom role, you can do so. [Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
  </br>

- ## **Cluster Role Binding**:

  We will bind the **Service Account** to the **Cluster Role** we just created. To do so the commands needed are:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRoleBinding
  metadata:
    name: <your-custom-name>
  subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: <Name-of-your-serviceaccount> 
    namespace: default
  roleRef:
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: cluster-admin
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  EOF
  ```

  Or you can apply the [YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/main/yamls/crb.yaml) file using:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/main/yamls/crb.yaml
  ```

- ## **Deploying the Pod**

  This is it! Now that we have the service account and the cluster role binding, we can deploy the pod. We can use this command to deploy the pod:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF 
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: <your-custom-name>
  spec:
    serviceAccount: <Name-of-your-serviceaccount> 
    containers:
    - name: <your-custom-name>
      image: kitarp29/k8s-api:8.0
      ports:
      - containerPort: 8000
  EOF
  ```
  or you can apply the [YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/main/yamls/pod.yaml) file using:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/main/yamls/pod.yaml
  ```
- ## **Port-forward**:
  
  Now that we have the pod deployed, we can use the *port-forward* command to access the pod. Expose a port of the pod to the local machine.
  To do so, we can use the following command:

  ```
  kubectl port-forward <your-pod-name> 8000:8000
  ```
> API will be running at <a href="localhost:8000/"> localhost:8000 </a> now.

  ## <u>**FAQ**</u> ü§î

  - **Is this a Unique Product?**
  
      No, this is not a unique product. There are similar implementations made by other developers.
  
  - **Purpose of this project?**

     It's a pet project to learn *Kubernetes* and *Golang*. I wanted to build this to better understand these two technologies. I also explored *Docker*.
