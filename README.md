#  <u>**Introduction**</u> üëãüèª

It is built on **Golang** and utilizes the **client-go** library to interact with Kubernetes Cluster.
It is a plug-and-play solution and can be used to create a kube-ez server. In three easy steps, you will have a simple API to interact with your cluster.
The aim is to build a simple API server that can be used to interact with any Kubernetes cluster.

 In my industrial experience, I have realized that **Kubernetes** is a very powerful tool but, only used by a handful of developers in the organization. The problem is not grasping the concept of the cluster. My last Product Manager was much more versed in AWS than I am. 
I feel the reason is that there is no easier way to interact with it.
This project will provide a bunch of API endpoints to perform various functions on the cluster. For now, I will have the Postman collections and API docs to achieve it, plan is to build a Dashboard on the API later.

**Docker Image: [kitarp29/k8s-api](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kitarp29/k8s-api)**
> Use the Docker image with tag 2.0 or above to run the kube-ez server.

# <u>**Getting started**</u> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To start using the project you need a Kubernetes Cluster and should have the right access to apply changes to the cluster.
There are two ways to run this project.
 ## 1. **Outside the Cluster**
 ## 2. **Inside the Cluster**

Steps to run the project are mentioned in the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/kitarp29/kube-ez/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

#  <u>**Project Features**</u> ü§Ø
  -  Get details about any resource in the cluster.
  -  It *detects* if you are trying to run the project inside or outside of a cluster.
  -  Create new resources in the cluster.
  -  Delete resources in the cluster.
  -  Run CLI commands using the API.
  -  Manage Helm Charts.
  -  You can add, install, delete and update HELM charts.
  -  Get live events from the cluster.
  -  It is a REST API to interact with the cluster.
  -  It has a health check endpoint as well.
  -  More coming soon... üöß

  # <u>**FAQ**</u> ü§î

  - **Is this a Unique Product?**
  
      No, this is not a unique product. There are similar implementations made by other developers.
  
  - **Purpose of this project?**

     It's a pet project to learn *Kubernetes* and *Golang*. I wanted to build this to better understand these two technologies. I also explored *Docker*.
